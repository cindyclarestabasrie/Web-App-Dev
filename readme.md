Introduction to this project

This is just the front end side of the final project of our course, Web Application Developmemt and Security. We are using PHP for the front end. 

Users can register, login, and navigate through pages using the navigation bar.
Users can also use live chat to chat with doctors registered. 

There is also feedback page so the users can give feedbacks regarding our website or the doctors registered and how we can further improve the website.
